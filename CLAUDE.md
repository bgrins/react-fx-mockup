This project creates an interactive mockup of the modern Firefox UI using TypeScript, React, Tanstack, and shadcn components. The mockup should precisely match Firefox's visual design (available with the Figma MCP tool) while providing basic interactive functionality.

You will have a dev server running at `localhost:3000`, you do not need to start it yourself. You can use the `playwright` tool to view the page, and you can use the `figma-dev-mode-mcp-server` tool to interact with mockups.

The top tabs allow migrating between different starting states for the app, but there should be a shared app shell and functionality that looks like a mockup you'd take as a screenshot in the area below.
